## What's done
The documentation and schema in this repo is written based on existing documentation and investigation of MESH python client withen by James Pickering.

[MESH Client](https://github.com/jamespic/mesh-client)

Useful in the investigation were materials suggested by Matt Mercer:
- [MESH reciever](https://git.digital.nhs.uk/DPS/yanai/blob/develop/docker/services/src/mesh_receiver/service.py)
- [MESH sender](https://git.digital.nhs.uk/DPS/yanai/blob/develop/docker/services/src/mesh_sender/service.py)


## What's to do
1. A Clear understanding on how to setup against the MESH API.

    The work with MESH is described, but the procces of getting on board is to do.
    In my opinion Alison Kinloch may be helpful to determinate the official path of the MESH installation. 
2. A Guide which walks-through setting up to work against MESH API.
    As above.
3. Test the endpoints and describe responses in the schema and the documentation.
