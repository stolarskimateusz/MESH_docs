    # Overview
    The Message Exchange HTTP API provides a RESTful interface to MESH to allow messages to be transferred between sender & recipient mailboxes.
    This HTTP API is used by all Mailboxes that send and/or receive messages through Message Exchange. This includes the following:
    - MESH Client - Sends HTTP Requests directly to the MESH HTTP API
    - DTS Client - Sends messages to the DTS Adapter which then delegates the action via the MESH HTTP API
    - 3rd Party Clients - External suppliers can create their own client implementations which upload & download files via the MESH HTTP API. (Right now this is limited to connections over the N3 network, but the work to allow this access via the internet is in procces.)
    - 'Internal' Applications - Messages can be sent from core Spine processes to external mailboxes by uploading messages via the MESH HTTP API

        It performs an authentication check on the Mailbox. This should be performed before the mailbox attempts to send or receive files. This action should be the first action in each polling cycle.

        The Check User Authentication message attempts to connect to a specific mailbox. This allows the user to ensure that their authentication is correct and will update the details of the connection history held for the mailbox. It can be considered similar to a keep-alive or a ping message in that it allows monitoring on the Spine to be aware of the ongoing utilisation of the inbox despite a lack of traffic.

        This message should be the first message sent in a ‘polling’ period for a mailbox. This allows the client to check that the MESH Server can be contacted and the mailbox is active before attempting to send/receive messages.
