<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Message Exchange for Social care and Health (MESH) component of the Spine allows messages and files to be delivered to registered recipients via a java client. Users register for a mailbox and install the client. The MESH client manages the sending of messages which users (typically user systems) have placed in an outbox directory on their machine.</p>
<p>It similarly manages the downloading of messages and files which other users have placed in the user’s virtual inbox on the Spine. The MESH server has been designed with an underlying HTTP based protocol. This protocol is capable of being used directly where user systems wish to bypass the MESH client or where they want to create their own clients. Thus the MESH service will become a direct 'store and retrieve' messaging mechanism between endpoints as a new asynchronous pattern for Spine consumers.</p>
<p>The Message Exchange HTTP API provides a RESTful interface to MESH to allow messages to be transferred between sender &amp; recipient mailboxes.
This HTTP API is used by all Mailboxes that send and/or receive messages through Message Exchange. This includes the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>MESH Client - Sends HTTP Requests directly to the MESH HTTP API</li>
<li>DTS Client - Sends messages to the DTS Adapter which then delegates the action via the MESH HTTP API</li>
<li>3rd Party Clients - External suppliers can create their own client implementations which upload &amp; download files via the MESH HTTP API. (Right now this is limited to connections over the N3 network, but the work to allow this access via the internet is in procces.)</li>
<li>'Internal' Applications - Messages can be sent from core Spine processes to external mailboxes by uploading messages via the MESH HTTP API</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="mesh-authorization-tokens">MESH Authorization Tokens</h2>
<p>Each message in the MESH REST API requires a custom authentication token to be passed in the Authorization Request Header. A new token must be generated for each HTTP Request, this can be acheived by regenerating it with a new Nonce or incremented NonceCount. The format of the Authorization token is the concatenation of the following elements (with a ':' separator between each element except after the schema name):</p>
<ul>
<li>'NHSMESH' - The name of the Custom Authentication Schema. The Authentication Header should prefix the generated authentication token with the name of this schema followed by a space character.</li>
<li>Mailbox ID - ID of the Mailbox sending the HTTP Request, must be uppercase.</li>
<li>Nonce - A GUID used as an encryption 'Nonce'</li>
<li>NonceCount - The number of times that the same 'Nonce' has been used.</li>
<li>Timestamp - The current date and time in 'yyyyMMddHHmm' format.</li>
<li>Hash Code - HMAC-SHA256 Hash Code generated from the concatenation of the following elements, joined by ':'
<ul>
<li>Mailbox ID - As above</li>
<li>Nonce - As above</li>
<li>Nonce Count - As above</li>
<li>Mailbox Password - The password for the MESH Mailbox.</li>
<li>Timestamp - As above</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following Request Header MUST be present in every HTTP Request:
<code>Authorization: NHSMESH MAILBOX01:73eefd69-811f-44d0-81f8-a54ff352a991:001:201511041205:3097fd5aa85a...f540942614b</code><br>
NB - The Shared Key to generate the HMAC-SHA256 hash will need to be manually requested from HSCIC.<br>
Websites are available to generate both GUIDs and HMAC-SHA256 hashes if required.</p>
<p>The Server will perform the following checks to authenticate the request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the User ID from the Recipient/Sender ID</li>
<li>Get the expected password from the MESH database</li>
<li>Use HMAC-SHA256 on the User ID, Password and the Nonce &amp; Nonce Count from the Request Header and check that the hashed values match. The Secret Key for the HMAC generation will be supplied by HSCIC on request.</li>
<li>Check that we have not already received this combination of User ID, Nonce &amp; Nonce Count on a previous HTTP request.</li>
<li>Check that we have not already received this combination of User ID, Nonce &amp; Nonce Count on a previous HTTP request. (Use a method similar to EBXml Dedupe to hold these values in a Redis DB?)</li>
<li>Check that the Timestamp is within allowable bounds (e.g. ± 2 hour of current time to allow for BST/GMT &amp; client/server clock differences)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mesh-polling-cycle">MESH Polling Cycle</h2>
<p>Each Mailbox should periodically check to see if any outbound files need to be sent via MESH and check to see if there are any files which have been sent to the Mailbox to download. If no messages are sent or received for a mailbox during a polling period then the mailbox should pause for a number of minutes (typically 5, 10, 15 minutes) before starting a subsequent polling cycle for the mailbox.</p>
<p>The basic pseudo-code for a mailbox’s polling cycle is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Authenticate Mailbox</li>
<li>For each file waiting to be sent:
<ul>
<li>Split the message into chunks of &lt;100MB</li>
<li>Send file to recipient indicating number of chunks
<ul>
<li>Upload message chunk</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fetch the list of messages in the Mailbox’s Inbox
<ul>
<li>For each available message:
<ul>
<li>Download the first part of the message</li>
<li>If identified as a chunked message
<ul>
<li>Save the first message chunk to the file system</li>
<li>For each of the remaining chunks
<ul>
<li>Download message chunk</li>
<li>Save the message chunk to the file system</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Acknowledge the successful receipt of the message</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mesh-usage-requirements">MESH usage requirements</h2>
<p>MESH usage requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>MESH messages MUST be less than 100MB. Messages over 100MB will be rejected with an error. However, note that the DDC has started considering chunking approaches to increase maximum message sizes.</li>
<li>Although the MESH is a highly reliable service, message exchange clients are responsible for end to end reliability of exchanges.</li>
<li>Endpoints
The basic pseudocode for a mailbox’s polling cycle is as follows:</li>
<li>Authenticate Mailbox</li>
<li>For each file waiting to be sent:
<ul>
<li>Send file to recipient</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fetch the list of messages in the Mailbox’s Inbox</li>
<li>For each available message:
<ul>
<li>Download the message</li>
<li>Save the message to the file system.</li>
<li>Acknowledge the successful receipt of the message</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="authenticate-mailbox-handshake">Authenticate Mailbox (handshake)</h3>
<p>It performs an authentication check on the Mailbox. This should be performed before the mailbox attempts to send or receive files. This action should be the first action in each polling cycle.</p>
<p>The Check User Authentication message attempts to connect to a specific mailbox. This allows the user to ensure that their authentication is correct and will update the details of the connection history held for the mailbox. It can be considered similar to a keep-alive or a ping message in that it allows monitoring on the Spine to be aware of the ongoing utilisation of the inbox despite a lack of traffic.</p>
<p>This message should be the first message sent in a ‘polling’ period for a mailbox. This allows the client to check that the MESH Server can be contacted and the mailbox is active before attempting to send/receive messages.</p>

<h3 id="send-a-message">Send a message</h3>
<p>This command uploads a message to the Message Exchange Server for onward delivery. The message is POSTed to the Sender's Virtual Outbox on the Spine. Meta-information is supplied in the request headers and the content of the message is supplied in the request body. Messages will be kept for five days before being deleted at which point a ‘message undelivered message’ is sent to the sender for information.</p>
<p>If senders have not received an acknowledgement within three days they <em>may</em> assume a failed delivery and consider re-sending. However the Spine does not determine fixed contract properties for MESH exchanges and users are free to agree alternative, more stringent, reliable exchange algorithms to suit their scenarios.</p>
<p>If a message is more than 100Mb in size then it should be split into multiple chunks which are then compressed and uploaded separately. The first chunk in a large message are uploaded via this Send Message request, with the addition of the Mex-Chunk-Range header which indicates that it is chunk 1 of n, which creates the message and returns the Message ID. The subsequent chunks with the obtained Message ID are then uploaded using individual the Upload Chunk requests. The message will only appear in the Recipient’s Inbox when the final chunk has been
successfully uploaded.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong> The support for large chunked messages is optional and so it is important to ensure that intended recipient of the large file can accept chunked files.</p>

<h3 id="acknowledge-message-download">Acknowledge message download</h3>
<p>Acknowledge the successful download of a message. This will remove the message from the Recipient's Inbox.</p>
<p>This message <strong>must</strong> be sent by the recipient to indicate that a message has been downloaded and saved correctly. This changes the status of the message and removes it from the recipient's inbox. Note that this acknowledgement closes the transaction on the Spine,acknowledgement but does not result in an associated acknowledgement message to the sending system.</p>
<p>Senders will receive notification of undelivered messages after five days. Senders <em>may</em> choose to check on the delivery status of a message in the meantime using the tracing API.</p>
